# Stage Observability Agent - autonomous operations for agentic applications

> **Goal:** use Azure Copilot Observability Agent (preview) to correlate alerts from the lab Application Insights resource, create issues, and investigate agentic-application failures with trace evidence.
>
> **Deployment model:** optional and off by default. Bicep creates a dedicated Azure Monitor workspace, `Microsoft.Monitor/observabilityAgents`, its monitored Application Insights child, and least-privilege RBAC. Terraform provisioning is not supported for this preview.
>
> **Safety default:** issue creation is automatic; deep investigation is manual. The agent does not automatically remediate resources.

## What this stage demonstrates

The Control Center emits bounded, synthetic OpenTelemetry-style dependency telemetry for three recognizable failure patterns:

1. A tool call is slow.
2. The agent chooses the wrong tool.
3. A multi-step task fails after earlier work succeeded.

Each scenario has deterministic `broken` and `fixed` profiles. Run the broken profile, investigate it, make or explain the targeted correction, run the fixed profile, and compare the evidence. Prompts and tool payloads are not recorded; the demo emits metadata such as scenario, operation, selected tool, expected tool, outcome, duration, and trace ID.

## Product boundaries

| Experience | Role in this lab |
|---|---|
| Azure Copilot Observability Agent | Portal-based alert correlation, issue creation, chat, and optional deep investigation over Application Insights telemetry. |
| Azure SRE Agent | Alert-driven incident investigation and Review-mode response plans across Azure Monitor resources. It is a separate optional stage. |
| Microsoft Foundry | Hosts the optional model workload and existing lab agents. |
| GitHub Copilot CLI / Azure tooling | Terminal-side code and resource investigation after an issue is identified. There is no documented direct Observability Agent integration with GitHub Copilot CLI in this preview. |
| Azure Monitor health models | Companion business-impact view using shared workload terminology. The lab does not claim that Observability Agent ingests health-model topology. |

MCP and coding-agent integration appeared as roadmap content in the LevelUp material used to design this stage. Do not present roadmap content as a deployed capability.

## Prerequisites and limits

- Stage A must already exist because the agent monitors `appi-<prefix>`.
- The deploying identity needs permission to create resources and role assignments. Owner or User Access Administrator plus an appropriate resource-deployment role is the practical lab setup.
- Supported public regions in this implementation are Australia East, Canada Central, Central US, East Asia, East US, South Central US, UK South, West Central US, and West Europe.
- The agent and its Azure Monitor workspace must be in the same supported region. The monitored Application Insights resource can remain in the primary lab region.
- The preview allows at most five Observability Agent resources per subscription.
- The portal supports one Application Insights target per agent. The API supports up to ten monitored targets; this lab deliberately uses one.
- ARM/Bicep and portal provisioning are supported. Azure CLI and Terraform provisioning are not supported preview provisioning paths. The validation script uses Azure CLI only to read the deployed ARM resources.

## Cost and privacy

- Autonomous alert correlation is currently unbilled during preview.
- Chat and deep investigation consume Azure Agent Credits (AAC).
- Deep investigation can consume up to 500 AAC per investigation.
- Automatic deep investigation can create unplanned usage, so `enableObservabilityAgentAutomaticInvestigation` defaults to `false`.
- Review current pricing and preview terms before every workshop; pricing is service-side and can change independently of this repository.
- Use only synthetic demo data. The Control Center requires explicit consent for every scenario run and records metadata only.

## Deploy

In `lab.config.json`, set:

```json
"observabilityAgentLocation": "westeurope",
"enableObservabilityAgentAutomaticInvestigation": false,
"observabilityAgentInstructions": "Correlate alerts for the lab application and its dependencies when they describe the same customer impact. Keep unrelated infrastructure alerts separate. Always create an issue for severity 1 or severity 2 agent task failures. Add [OPS-REVIEW] to issue titles.",
"stageToggles": {
  "enableStageObservabilityAgent": true
}
```

The one-shot Bicep deployment reads those values through `scripts/sync-config.ps1`.

For a staged deployment after Stage A:

```powershell
az deployment group create `
  --subscription '<subscription-id>' `
  --resource-group '<resource-group>' `
  --name stage-observability-agent `
  --template-file infra/stages/70-observability-agent.bicep `
  --parameters namePrefix=amlab `
               observabilityAgentLocation=westeurope `
               enableAutomaticInvestigation=false
```

The stage creates:

- `obs-<prefix>-<suffix>` with a system-assigned identity.
- `amw-<prefix>-obs`, a dedicated Azure Monitor workspace in the same region.
- One enabled Application Insights monitored-resource child.
- Issue Contributor on the dedicated workspace.
- Monitoring Reader on the monitored subscription.

Monitoring Contributor is intentionally not assigned because the lab does not enable remediation.

## Validate

Deployment wrappers run the validator automatically when the stage is enabled. You can rerun the read-only checks:

```powershell
./scripts/setup-observability-agent.ps1 `
  -SubscriptionId '<subscription-id>' `
  -ResourceGroup '<resource-group>'
```

The script verifies the subscription and tenant guard, region, identity, issue and investigation operations, monitored Application Insights resource, and both RBAC assignments. It prints the portal URL only after validation succeeds.

## Demo workflow

1. Open the deployed App Service and sign in as an approved lab operator.
2. Open **Foundry Playground** and find **Troubleshooting scenarios**.
3. Choose **Slow customer lookup**, **Wrong tool selection**, or **Partial task failure**.
4. Select **Broken**, approve synthetic telemetry generation, and select **Generate Trace**.
5. Open Application Insights transaction search and follow the returned trace ID through the `GenAI` and `AgentTool` dependencies.
6. Open Observability Agent from the Control Center. Review correlated issues or ask it to explain the evidence and distinguish application, model, tool, and downstream failures.
7. Challenge the conclusion: verify timestamps, tool name, duration, expected tool, downstream dependency, and missing evidence.
8. Select **Fixed**, approve another run, and compare the new trace. Confirm the measured outcome changed; do not accept a code or configuration change as proof by itself.

Use the additional customer scenarios in [DEMO-SCENARIOS.md](DEMO-SCENARIOS.md) for alert storms, token-cost spikes, deployment regressions, and platform-versus-application failures.

## Teardown

Use the lab teardown so the Observability Agent is deleted explicitly before asynchronous resource-group removal:

```powershell
./scripts/teardown.ps1 -Yes
```

If retaining the rest of the lab, delete the Observability Agent before its dedicated workspace and remove its subscription role assignment. Confirm that no billable investigation is still running.
